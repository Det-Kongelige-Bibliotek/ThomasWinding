# Thomas Winding Exhibition

Thomas Winding exhibition is meant for kids. We created a small website for each device (2 TVs and 4 iPads at the moment), the same structure but different materials. To avoid repeating the code and copy pasting the name of the new files, it is only needed to follow the following steps:

1. Copy paste the folder including video and img folders and an Excel sheet, from T:\ThomasWinding, to your Mac or Linux computer(The following steps are described in those OSs) into the ThomasWinding folder.

2. Convert .XSLX file to .CSV file and put it into the same folder.

3. Download Scripts folder and put it into ThomasWinding folder.

4. Open the command line and cd into 'ThomasWinding/scripts' path.

5. Type 'bash commands.sh ipad4', which 'ipad4' is the name of the folder you copied to the ThomasWinding folder.

6. Done!

There are two more files:
1- settings.xml: This file contains the settings needed for ipads.
2- scripts/settings.txt: This file tells you have to configure TVs, to act as a kiosk.
